          Moved to Canada and joined Cato Research, International Contract Research Organization helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies bring new drugs, biologics, and medical devices to the public. There I learnt, through clinical trial design, how placebos seem to have an effect in about 1 out of 3 patients (Source: American Cancer Society). In charge of the relocation of our Montreal offices, I happened to work with an interior designer to design the new floor plan. How spaces (rooms, offices) affect our well-being was really starting to intrigue me.
