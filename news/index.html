        Thank you for all you have done for us: we love our living room. Yesterday my daughter visited and said, once again: "This room is a haven of calm". She is right and it is your vision and talent that made it happen. We have enjoyed working with you as well as enjoying getting to know you. We hope we will have future opportunities to get together. Merci beaucoup!

        Thank you again for your assistance with the house. We are very pleased with all the colors and the accents you have suggested. Your solutions and decorating ideas are really amazing. We loved how you worked with our existing furniture and also lots of economical suggestions to work within our budget. Can't wait to tackle the remaining rooms.

        Celine brings a fresh view and creative energy to her projects. She shares great design and shopping tips. She was able to take our unused space and with her imagination, energy and style, turn it into a restful, beautiful space that we use daily. She combines a beautiful sense of style with her imagination and color sense to create an oasis in your home and all this with a small budget!

        Dear Celine,We want to thank you for your fantastic service.  We were at a loss as to how to design our oddly configured TV room and our kitchen.  Although we have lived in our house for over 20 years, we were stumped on how to design these rooms.  In 2.5 hours, you came up with two designs in remarkable detail that addressed our concerns and accommodated our needs.  You listened and applied what you heard.  It was very easy to talk to you and we felt at ease.  Thank you very much and we look forward to engaging you again. Kindest regards.

        This course was enormously helpful to me as I am currently staging my home for sale. I have put many suggestions to use and am extremely pleased with the outcomes. I am also further intrigued to pursue this as a new carreer.
