            Céline founded CHIC Redesign in 2003.
            <br><br>
            Born and raised in Normandy (France) in a picturesque coastal village, she considers her designs like French cuisine: the use of simple flavorsome ingredients with minimal processing, in small portions but bursting with character.
            <br><br>
            Trained as an environmental engineer from one of the most prestigious colleges in France, she is very practical and a born problem solver.
            <br><br>
            Her creations are a balanced mix of energy and comfort, the results of years of research and observation on the effects of a positive environment on people's general well-being.
            <br><br>
            She loves to share her passion for interior redesign, as a design instructor in Keefe Tech Continuing Education program, and as a columnist for the Metrowest Daily News.
            <br><br>
            Her diverse clientele* shows that Celine and her team are excellent at translating ideas no matter what their clients' cultural heritage may be. (* CHIC clients' countries of origin in alphabetical order: Canada, China, Cuba, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Portugal, Russia, Uganda, USA, Vietnam)
